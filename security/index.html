    <h1>Security Assessment of 2048 Game Center</h1>
    <p id="author">by Thomas Strassner</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Product: Created by Connor McCann, it is a "Game-Center" in which
            the user can play the popular game, 2048, and see all of their high
            scores.</li>
        <li>Objective of this report: My inention is to find security flaws in
            the application, describe them, and offer helpful ways to resolve them.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>In my approach, I had two primary methodologies. First, I used curl from
        the command line, experimenting by posting a wide variety of parameters
        to the POST request. I tried leaving out fields, adding additional
        fields, and sending improper input for each field. My second methodology
        was examining the server-side source code. The main JavaScript file is
        only 156 lines, so it was easy to get a handle on and examine properly.
    </p>

    <h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>
    <p>In my evaluation, I found three securtiy flaws: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A user could easily cheat, giving themselves any username and any
            score, without even actually playing the game. While this does not
            pose any major malicious threat, it must be fixed immediately, as
            honest users will quickly be dettered from using the application
            if all of the highest scores are fake.
        </li>
        <li>A malicous user could essentially put anything they want onto the
            webpage, or redirect the page entirely, by injecting their own code.
            It is vital that this issue is patched as soon as possible, before
            the website is compromised.
        </li>
        <li>A user could make the application store anything they want as the
            grid object. While I do not believe you have to worry about
            anything very sinister happening here, it could result in a user
            receiving bogus data when requesting their scores.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Issus Found</h2>
    <h3>Issue 1: Inject false score with curl</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Location: submit.json</li>
        <li>Severity: Medium. This would be really annoying and make it very
            easy for users to cheat, but there's nothing very malicious about
            entering a false score.</li>
        <li>I found this issue by doing a simple POST request via curl. As you
            can see in the images below, I inserted my own score without
            actually playing the game. The first image is the curl command and
            the second image is my new high score (with fake username, hack). 
            <br><br>
            <img id="fsi" src="images/false-score-injection.png" alt="Curl Command">
            <br>
            <img src="images/false-high-score.png" alt="False High Score">
            </li>
        <li>Resolution: This issue seems difficult to resolve without making
            major changes to the application. As long as the username and score
            are sent this way with the grid via submit.json, I don't think this
            can be prevented. One solution I did think would be to store users
            and sessions in the database, and force users to sign in anytime
            they play. Then you could limit the username to only the one
            currently logged in. It should be noted that this is out of the
            scope of my knowledge of web applications, and is only speculation
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Issue 2: Inject script</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Location: submit.json</li>
        <li>Severity: High. This sort of attack could get very dangerous. When
            a user can insert their own script into the database, there is
            almost no limit to what they can do. In the case of this 2048
            gamcenter, I could inject a script that redirects the user to a
            completely different page</li>
        <li>I discovered this issue by experimenting with curl. If I put in a
            script tag instead of my username, then I the site will execute it.
            For example, in the image below, you see a curl command that I used
            to load the Wikipedia page on Code Injection, rather than the 2048
            gamecenter application.
            <br><br>
            <img id="si" src="images/script-injection.png" alt="Script injection">
            <br><br>
        </li>
        <li>Resolution: This issue can be resolved by validating each field in
            a POST request, before inserting into the database. On the server-
            side, you could validate username by using <code>str.match()</code>
            and reject it if there are any puntuation characters. However, it
            should be noted that this would also require the client side
            application to inform the user beforehand that they cannot have
            any punctuation in their username. The score can be validated simply
            by using the JavaScript <code>isNaN()</code> function.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Issue 3: No validation of JSON grid</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Location: submit.json and scores.json</li>
        <li>Severity: Low. There doesn't seem to be anything truly malicious
            that could go on here. The only issue is that when I use curl to
            post JSON with improper format as the grid parameter, it will then
            return the bogus JSON when the user requests that data back via
            scores.json.</li>
        <li>I figured this out by examining the source code. The server
            inserts and grabs the JSON to and from the database without ever
            validating it.
        </li>
        <li>Resolution: This could be resolved by using <code>JSON.parse()</code>
            in a try catch block, before inserting into the database. This way,
            you only have to worry about it once, when you insert, rather than
            every time you retrieve it and send it somehwere else.
        </li>
    </ul>  
    <hr>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The most important fix that needs to be made is preventing a user from
        submitting any data they want via curl, and any other similar tools.
        I described one possible solution to this in my resolution to issue 2.
        However, this would require a total restructuing of the server and the
        database, so you should handle this with care. Other than this, I do
        not believe there are any serious security flaws. From what I can tell,
        this is a well-made application.
